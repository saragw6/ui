      <div class="title"><a href="http://hd2yq4.axshare.com/menu.html" target="new">Jumpoffcampus</a></div> is a user interface project that I worked on with a partner in my Human-Computer Interaction course this semester. We created a web prototype for a mobile app to help Tufts University students find off-campus housing and form a community to share advice for the housing search. Over a period of several weeks we created a preliminary design report, a full design and specification, a low-fidelity prototype that we tested ourselves, and then a medium fidelity prototype for formal usability testing. Finally, we redesigned and implemented the prototype you see at the link, based on the results of our user testing. We used Axure RP to create our prototypes, so what you see is not an example of my code, but it is an interface prototype I created.

      <div class="title"><a href="http://saragw6.github.io/music-personality/" target="new">Twenty/Twenty</a></div> is a music personality quiz I created with a group in my Web Programming course last semester. Our assignment was simply to create any web application having to do with music. We worked together to create a buzzfeed-esque personality quiz that builds a song as the user responds to questions. Users can see how their answers compare to others’, share their results on Facebook, or enter another user’s “song code” to hear a friend’s results. I found this project extremely rewarding because we had the freedom to create whatever we envisioned. Furthermore, we got to put together all of the tools we had learned so far, and we also pushed ourselves to learn a few more along the way. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, Node.js, geolocation, Bootstrap, MongoDB, local storage, the Facebook API, and more to create this quiz and we were overjoyed to see our hard work come together in a tangible product.
